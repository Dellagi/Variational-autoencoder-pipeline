### End-to-End Variational Autoencoder pipeline with Spark, Kafka and Flask

This project is an implementation of a variational autoencoder as part of a data pipeline for anomaly detection. The data pipeline uses a combination of flask, kafka, and spark to capture an image stream (e.g., a live stream from CCTV or in general any iot).
